/**
 *  --== Dataflow Task ==--
 *
 *  The Dataflow tasks give you an easy-to-grasp abstraction of mutually-independent logical tasks or threads,
 *  which can run concurrently and exchange data solely through Dataflow Variables, Queues, Broadcasts and Streams.
 *
 *  Dataflow tasks with their easy-to-express mutual dependencies and inherently sequential body could also be used as
 *  a practical implementation of UML Activity Diagrams .
